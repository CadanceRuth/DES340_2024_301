      <p>Binaries are built from a number of different branches and PRs but you should stick to the master branch releases for the most stable ones unless you know exactly what you are looking for.</p>

      <h2>We currently build on both GitHub Actions and Cirrus CI:</h2>

      <p>GitHub Actions is used for building the majority of our binaries and builds are run on every commit or PR.
Direct artifact download is available only for those with at least read permission on the repository. All artifacts are therefore automatically uploaded to the pulsar-edit/pulsar-rolling-releases repository for access by anyone.
Cirrus CI is only used for building Apple silicon (macOS M1/M2) and ARM Linux binaries. These are run less frequently (every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday).
      To download a binary produced by GitHub Actions then follow the below steps: <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/klos/carbon-fiber-concert-ukuleles">Click here</a></p>

      <p>Navigate to the pulsar-edit/pulsar-rolling-releases releases.
      Select the most recent release (or for a specific release reference the timestamp part of the version e.g. 1.109.2023091606).
      Most binaries will be available with every release but Apple silicon and ARM Linux binaries will not. You may need to look for earlier releases.
      Choose the binary you wish to download from the Assets section (you may need click the Show all x assets link to display them all). See below for descriptions of all available binaries.
      To download a binary from Cirrus CI (Apple silicon and ARM Linux only) please follow the below steps:</p>

      <p>Go to the master branch Pulsar Cirrus CI page.
      Select the latest successful build (check for a finished green check mark âœ… on the right side of the page - make sure you do not select a failed one).
      Select your system from the list of options:
      arm-linux - ARM based Linux systems (Raspberry Pi etc.)
      silicon_mac - M1 and M2 chip Apple Macs
      Select binary > binaries from the Artifacts pane
      Download the binary you require for your system
